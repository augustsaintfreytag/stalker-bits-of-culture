		<text>Well, there is something important that needs looking at. A special infiltration mission to Rostok is planned, I must keep the details secret sorry. We need some equipment to perfect the disguise of our special operatives in order for them to blend in perfectly. We need 5.45x39 HP rounds, about 10 full boxes, so that they can defend themselves against mutants on the road to Rostok without alerting the checkpoint guards. If things go south our men will need some army grade medical supplies as well, 5 complete army medkits should do. Don't fret, your payment will be adequate. If you go the extra mile and get some cocaine and some reading material, you'll even get a bonus, this should help our operatives to bribe some Duty members to accomplish their mission. So, you in?</text>
